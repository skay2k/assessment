Assessment

The required data structure 
[{
"heartRate":80
},{
"someOtherMeasure":70
},{
"anotherMeasure":50
}
]
was it a List of objects with key / value but without unique key integrity.

As the intention described was key / value more than a simple list of objects,
I don't know if it was made on purpose, ans as I can't ask question, 
I decided to change to a slighly different interface with a hashMap - so with uique keys.

In normal condition I would never decide before asking, but as this is an assessment, 
I decided to underline this issue.


{
"heartRate":80.0
,
"someOtherMeasure":70.0
,
"anotherMeasure":50.0
}


Sample data :

{"user":"it@skay.ch",
"begin":"2019-07-01T09:47:46.000+0000",
"end":"2019-07-01T10:47:46.000+0000",
"data":	{
"heartRate":80.0
,
"someOtherMeasure":70.0
,
"anotherMeasure":50.0
}

}
